/*

 * Sleep
   Sometimes cookies are not sent with the request. This will result in opening a generic page,
   e.g. IMDb not signed-in, in different that desired language, etc.
   Not sure why and if it's Firefox only problem. Waiting couple of seconds helps resolve this issue.

 * The issue with original GM script and with similar GM solutions
   * Google does not always stop at the Redirection Notice, this script must detect such cases and
	 not force the redirection.
	 * When the result is on a Google affiliated site, or otherwise approved.
	   In such case *iflsig* parameter is present in URI.
	 * The same for Picture Search results and *psig* parameter.
   * The parameter *q* might be empty. (read below)

 * The purpose of the Redirection Notice is to avoid redirecting to possible bogus and fraudulent
   web pages. It might not be desired to circumvent this safety measure in all cases.
   If this is required only for a limited set of target web sites, create a list in config.sites array.

 * Parameters Google uses Redirection Notice URI
	iflsig: A Google signature which authenticates trusted target redirects.
	psig:   As iflsig, but for Google Picture Search.
	ved:    Referrer
	ust:    Did not investigate the meaning. [Number]
	usg:    Did not investigate the meaning. [a-Z0-9_]
	url:    The target URI. (A new version/substitute for 'q'?)
	q:      The target URI. When *url* is used, *q* is present, but empty.

 * Examples and the format of the *I Feel Lucky* search
   https://www.google.com/search?q=site:imdb.com+matrix&btnI=

   I don't remember how I initialized the *I Feel Lucky Search* and how following links were produced.
   It was 4 years ago from now 2023.
   These links worked only around 5 minutes, until the signature was changed.
